# Description

A very simple sample of retrofit client & generate the client file in project. So, I am going to create an app of Retrofit in a flutter with very easy and understandable code. I also integrate a dependency injection in this app.That dependencies will help to handle all data parsing and we need to write less code.

# Dependencies

 - retrofit: ^1.3.4+1
 - dio: ^3.0.10
 - built_value: ^7.1.0
 - json_annotation: ^3.1.0

# Conclusion

I hope this article has cleared up some of the major question marks regrading to the Hero aniamtion. I am exploring the flutter framework, and will report all of my new findings.
